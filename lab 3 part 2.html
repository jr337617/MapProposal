    <h1>Writing your project proposal</h1>
    <p>Brownfields are sites of land that are unable to be used because of their previous industrial or commercial use and they are often chemically contaminated which leaves land behind that is unable to be used for other purposes. There are many of these spaces all across the state of Ohio after many cities have struggled as a result of their post-industrial economy. These sites need to be funded by programs like the EPA in order for environmental clean up to take place and leave opportunity for the land to be used for a different purpose. The redevelopment of these cites can encourage revitalization in many cities who are struggling in the post-industrial economy. Redeveloped sites can increase property values and encourage the use of more spaces that could spark growth in these city’s economies. It is important to understand the relationship of brownfield sites and their relationship to property values as well as population density to comprehend how the redevelopment of brownfields can grow cities.  </p>
    <ol>
        <li><i class="heading">Purpose </i>The purpose of my map is to highlight the amount of brownfields that exist across Ohio. The problem I am trying to convey is the brownfields are lowering property values in communities all around Ohio who have lost many of their industrial sites and are unable to use because of contamination. By developing these sites they will provide a higher home value for the communities they exist in. This map is intended for people who are concerned about environmental justice issues across Ohio as well as people who are interested in the state of industrial cities across Ohio as well and the landscape that industrial sites left behind. I want to understand better which cities are really suffering from a surplus of brownfields. I want to include interactivity to show which brownfields have been developed or granted money versus which ones are still looking for funding.</li>
        <li><i class="heading">Structure </i>This paragraph explains the structure of my map. My geographic scale will be only the state of Ohio. It will include a map of Brownfield sites throughout the state, it will show population density across the state as well as median home value. I will show population density using a choropleth map, I will show median home value using an isarithmic map and graduated symbols to show brownfields across Ohio. I will provide supplementary information in the map using the information about the funding of brownfields and their past use.</li>
        <li><i class="heading">Data Sources </i>My data about brownfields will come from the Ohio EPA’s Ohio Brownfield Inventory Data base where it logs all of the Brownfields that have applied for funding or grants. I will also use census data for the other two factors, median home value and population density.</li>
        <li><i class="heading">Methodology </i>I will need to use coordinates of the brownfield sites in order to plot them on a map possible using google earth pro and converting them into a map where I can also input the census data. I will use a table in excel and join the table to ArcGIS in order to input the census data about population density and median home value.</li>
